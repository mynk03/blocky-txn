# State Package

The state package implements a Merkle Patricia Trie (MPT) for managing the blockchain state, including account balances and nonces. It provides a secure and efficient way to store and retrieve account information while maintaining cryptographic integrity.

## Overview

The state package consists of two main components:
- **MptTrie**: A Merkle Patricia Trie implementation for state management
- **Account**: Account structure and serialization utilities

## Key Components

### 1. MptTrie (`mpTrie.go`)

The MptTrie is a Merkle Patricia Trie implementation that:
- Stores account information in a cryptographically secure trie structure
- Provides efficient account lookup and updates
- Maintains state root hash for integrity verification
- Supports trie copying for state transitions

Key functions:
- `NewMptTrie()`: Creates a new MPT instance
- `PutAccount(address, account)`: Stores an account in the trie
- `GetAccount(address)`: Retrieves an account from the trie
- `RootHash()`: Returns the current state root hash
- `Copy()`: Creates a copy of the trie

### 2. Account (`accounts.go`)

The Account structure represents user accounts with:
- Balance: Account's token balance
- Nonce: Transaction counter for replay protection

Key functions:
- `Serialize()`: Converts account to bytes
- `Deserialize()`: Converts bytes to account
- `addressToNibbles()`: Converts Ethereum addresses to trie-compatible format

## Implementation Details

### Merkle Patricia Trie

The MPT implementation:
- Uses neo-go's MPT implementation
- Stores data in nibble format for efficient traversal
- Maintains cryptographic hashes for integrity
- Supports in-memory and persistent storage

### Account Management

Account operations:
- Automatic account creation for unknown addresses
- Balance and nonce tracking
- JSON serialization for storage
- Address conversion to nibble format

## Usage Example

```go
// Create a new MPT
trie := state.NewMptTrie()

// Create an account
account := &state.Account{
    Balance: 1000,
    Nonce:   0,
}

// Store the account
address := common.HexToAddress("0x123...")
err := trie.PutAccount(address, account)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// Retrieve the account
storedAccount, err := trie.GetAccount(address)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// Get the state root hash
rootHash := trie.RootHash()
```

## Testing

The package includes comprehensive tests:
- `mpTrie_test.go`: MPT functionality tests
- `account_test.go`: Account serialization tests

## Dependencies

- `github.com/nspcc-dev/neo-go/pkg/core/mpt`: MPT implementation
- `github.com/nspcc-dev/neo-go/pkg/core/storage`: Storage interface
- `github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/common`: Ethereum utilities
- `github.com/sirupsen/logrus`: Logging

## Performance Considerations

1. **Memory Usage**
   - MPT nodes are stored in memory
   - Account data is serialized for storage
   - Consider implementing pruning for long-running nodes

2. **Lookup Performance**
   - O(log n) complexity for account lookups
   - Efficient nibble-based addressing
   - Cached storage for frequently accessed accounts

3. **State Transitions**
   - Copy operation for state transitions
   - Efficient root hash calculation
   - Minimal storage overhead

## Security Considerations

1. **State Integrity**
   - Cryptographic hashing of state
   - Secure account storage
   - Protection against unauthorized modifications

2. **Account Management**
   - Automatic account creation
   - Nonce tracking for replay protection
   - Balance validation
